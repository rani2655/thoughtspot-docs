[#9-4-0-cl-contextual]
[discrete]
=== Contextual Change Analysis

// Naomi

// GA in 9.4.0.cl

Contextual change is now GA and on by default. You can now identify the key change drivers for changes in your metrics in a KPI chart. This feature is now available for administrators to enable, without contacting ThoughtSpot Support. Select the percent change label or select any two data points on the KPI sparkline to view change analysis on your top 5 columns by usage-based ranking (UBR) and identify the reason behind the observed change. You can view the changes in other columns by clicking *Manage attributes* and selecting the desired column(s). This feature must be enabled by your administrator.

[#9-4-0-cl-date-picker]
[discrete]
=== Date picker enhancement in Search

// Naomi

We added support for rolling, fixed, and custom date filters when creating an Answer or filtering a Liveboard. Previously, when adding a date filter to a Search, ThoughtSpot supported the conditions `ON (=)`, `ON OR AFTER (>=)`, `BEFORE (<)`, and `BETWEEN`. Now, you can additionally filter for `ON OR BEFORE (\<=)`, `NOT BETWEEN`, `ON LAST`, and `ON NEXT`. To try it out, click the filter icon next to the Date column in the left side menu, or click the date filter below the Answer or Liveboard title. For more information, see
