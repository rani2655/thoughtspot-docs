Spotter is a simple, self-service, chat-based interface for getting answers from your data. Spotter enables you to talk to your data in a whole new way.

With Spotter, it’s as simple as connecting to a data source, coaching Spotter on the types of questions you want to ask, and then chatting with Spotter to get answers.

To sign up for the trial edition of Spotter, go to: <link-to-be-added>.

Introducing Spotter, our new AI-powered, unified conversational search experience. This feature replaces the previous Sage search experience. When enabled, you can enter the Spotter interface from the search bar on the Home page, or by clicking *Spotter* on any visualization pinned to a Liveboard.

You can ask successive questions to hone in on business insights, open a preview of the underlying data, drill down, edit or undo changes to the resulting AI-generated Answers, see what terms Spotter changed from question to question, and submit feedback to train Spotter's interpretations. Analysts can also coach Spotter on how to interpret certain terms from the Admin page. To enable this feature, contact your administrator.

Existing Worksheets continue to be available, but Worksheet creation is disabled by default. To enable Worksheet creation, you must contact your ThoughSpot administrator.

We made the following changes to permissions regarding version control:

* Admin users can now assign the *Can set up version control* privilege to allow non-admin users to access the version control settings under *Admin > Application settings*, and to use Version Control REST v2 APIs.

* We renamed the previous *Can manage version control* permission to *Can toggle version control for objects*. Users with this permission and edit access to a ThoughtSpot object can enable or disable version history for that object.
